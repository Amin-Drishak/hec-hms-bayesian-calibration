# HEC-HMS Bayesian Calibration (Toy Basin)

**Author:** Muhammad Amin Khan  
**Purpose:** Demonstration of Bayesian/MCMC calibration for a simplified HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model.

This example:
1. Sets up a **toy basin** with synthetic rainfall and flow data.
2. Uses a Bayesian sampler to estimate model parameters.
3. Produces uncertainty bounds on simulated hydrographs.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- PyMC3 (for Bayesian inference)
- HEC-HMS CLI (conceptual use)

## Example Output

**Note:** Uses synthetic data for clarity â€” intended as a scaffold for real calibration workflows.
