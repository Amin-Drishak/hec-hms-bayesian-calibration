# HEC-HMS Bayesian Calibration (Demo)

This repo demonstrates a **toy example** of calibrating a hydrologic model using Bayesian/MCMC sampling.
Steps:
1. Define a synthetic observed hydrograph
2. Run a simple MCMC loop to adjust model parameters
3. Compare simulated vs observed flows

All data here are illustrative.
